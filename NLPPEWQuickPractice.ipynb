        "This is a quick forway into basic NLP. I recently read a Pew report discussing global views on the state of respondents' nations in comparison to fifty years ago. Being aware of and interested in, though not extrememly experienced with, Natural Language Processing, I decided to look into what this would say about survey reports and the questions being asked. There is a wide perception that news media should be objective and neutral. Would reporting on global attitudes be able to maintain this tone when discussing people's subjective feelings? How might the design of the question factor into this? At the end, I will attempt some rewritings of the question to see how this might be different. The sentiment analysis runs on a scale from negative one, most negative, to positive one, most positive, with zero being perfectly neutral. \n",

It is important to note that of the top five, three were undergoing post-war reconstruction fifty years years ago and one, one was suffering domestic turmoil and has seen its fortunes improve with market reforms, and the fifth was mired in a war. As such, there was a great deal of room for improvement. \n",

It is almost certain the Pew takes these factors into account, but for other start-up organizations looking to gauge public opinion, these dynamics will need to be considered. Consultations with linguists and native speakers would do well in aiding in this process. \n",
