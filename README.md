# PortfolioProjects
## This is where I collect my projects

The two Disney+ SQL pieces are exploratory analyses of the roster of the platform's offerings (cerca 2018). I used the available metrics to see how certain genres performed in comparison to others, along with how individual pieces within each genre stacked up against other works of the same genre. In some cases this was made difficult as certain films or shows were assigned multiple genre values within the "genres" column and, as such, there was often only one example that mateched all of the listed genres (i.e., itself). Interestingly, in exploring this dataset, I found many titles that I had not seen in my own account, which probably reflects the different market availabilities. A good VPN service would be needed to further explore this. 

I have also included a quick and simple sentiment analysis of a Pew Research report on global sentiment about the condition of society. It was an interesting poll, but due to lack of access to the methodology and questions that would have been used for each country (and how linguistic norms would affect respondents' answers) it is very limited in scope. 

In another project I used the YouTube API to query information about one of my favorite channels. I performed EDA, feature engineering, and visualization on the popularity of videos and release rate. I conclude with a recommendation about how to maintain output and increase views in period when there are not many Hollywood releases.
